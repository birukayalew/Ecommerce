        <p>
            I am originally from Dessie, Ethiopia, and I was born on January 22 in 2000EC. As mom told me,
            I was cheerful and sociable with peoples but I was always troublsome when a new comer comes to home. I just began school when
            I was seven years old at Nibo Kotu,Dessie. During my childhood, I always prefer to play with my friends rather than learning at school.
            But, my mother was pushing me to give my attention to education. She was a teacher and she was helping me till I get in HighSchool.
            When I become grade 5, my mother moved to another place and I went to a new school with her.It was called Messal.
            It was not that match different from Nibo Kotu. I was excited with my new friends, home ,and teachers. 
            After years, I began to prepare for the Regional Ministry Examination. And, I was able to pass with a good score.
            Follwing that, I registered at the new school called Catholic.

        <p>Everything was new for me. Most of the students are wealthy and they spent a lot of money at school for luxturies.Most of the students were
            also creative and intelligent. Thus, to have a good score, I have to compete with them. This was the moment, I have got a lot of friends.
            We play together, we eat together, we work our homeworks together, everything was special. We also compete each other to stood first and to
            get a book reward from the school Principals. The teachers were also ineresting. They give us everything they know. In the summer, we began to
            prepare for the National Examination. We were able to pass with a good score. My families were too happy. We moved on and get
            in to preparatory. It was also the best time I haver ever get with my friends. We were doning a lot of funs since we were preparing to pass Grade 12
            and get into university. We celebrate different days together. Needless to say, I was reading hard to get a good score. Finally, we took the examination
            and we passed with a good grade. Then, we were afraid when we think that university is awaiting us. This was the moment that I learned how leaving someone  you loved hurts.

        <p>
            After preparatory, I was placed at Addis Ababa University to study enginnering So, I went there to begin my own life. There was a lot of rumors that university was difficult to pass and it needs 
            hard work to score a good grade. But, my elder brother had told me everything and I was accustomed to it. I have got a new friends from different nations 
            and I got my own dorm. I was able to be friend with my dormitories with in a days and it was great to know different persons atitiude.
            Our first semester course was pre engineering. It was the difficult semester for me. The rumors were true, it needs hard work to coup up with it. 
            When we finish pre engineering, we choose a field and I become one of software enginnering students at AAIT. It was my interest and I want to do 
            better thing in my life. For the upcoming years, we learned computer languages like Java,Python and Script languages. At this time, my computer was
            my best friend. Now, I am trying to learn different things by working on class projects and assignments. Besides, in the summer, I planned to master
            some topics like Java.
