                        I am originally from Dessie, Ethiopia, and I was born on January 22 in 2000 and I was the last male child at that moment. As mom told me,<br>
                        I was cheerful and sociable with peoples but I was always disturbing my mom when a new comer comes to home. I just began school when <br>
                        I was seven years old at Nibo Kotu,Dessie, but at  that time I prefer to play with my friends rather than learning at school.<br>
                        But, my mother was pushing me to put my attention on education. She was a teacher and she was helping me till I get in HighSchool.<br>
                         

                        When I become grade 5, my mother moved to another place and I went to the new school with her.It was called Messal.<br> 
                        It was not that match different from Nibo Kotu. I was excited with my new friends, home ,and teachers. <br>
                        After years, I began to prepare for the Regional Ministry Examination. And, I was able to pass with a good score.<br>
                        Follwing that, I registered at the new school called Catholic.

                            Everything was new for me. Most of the students are wealthy and they spent a lot of money at school for luxturies.Most of the students were<br>  
                            also creative and intelligent. Thus, to have a good score, I have to compete with them. This was the moment, I have got a lot of friends.<br>
                            We play together, we eat together, we work our homeworks together, everything was special. We also compete each other to stood first and to<br>
                            get a book reward from the school Principals. The teachers were also ineresting. They give us everything they know. In the summer, we began to<br><br>
                            prepare for the National Examination. We were able to pass with a good score. My families were too happy because of my result. We moved on and get<br>
                            in to preparatory. It was also the best time I haver ever get with my friends. We were doning a lot of funs since we were preparing to pass Grade 12<br>
                            and get into university. We celebrate different days together. Needless to say, I was reading hard to get a good score. Finally, we took the examination<br>
                            pass with a good grade. It was the time to join university. This was the moment that I learned how leaving someone and go away hurts.

                            I was placed at Addis Ababa and I came to here to begin my own life. There was a lot of rumors that university was difficult to pass and it needs <br>
                            hard work to score a good grade. But, my elder brother had told me everything and I was accustomed to it. I have got a new friends from differnet nations <br>
                            and I got my own dorm-a new moment for me. I was able to be friend with my dormitories with in a days and it was great to know different persons attiude.<br>
                            Our first semester course was pre engineering. It was the difficult semester for me. The rumors were true, it needs hard work to coup up with it. <br><br>
                            When we finish pre engineering, we choose a field and I become one of software enginnering students at AAIT. It was my interest and I want to do <br>
                            better thing in my life. For the upcoming years, we learned computer languages like Java,Python and Script languages. At this time, my computer was<br>
                            my best friend. Now, I am trying to learn different things by working on class projects and assignments. Besides, in the summer, I planned to master<br>
                            some topics like Java. I am now second year software enginnering student and in the future I have a plan to study Artificial Intelligence.
